# AI & Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository serves as a collection of everything I have learned in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It includes notes, assignments, projects, and implementations of various algorithms and concepts.

## Contents
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks covering different AI/ML concepts.
- **Projects**: Hands-on implementations of ML models.
- **Assignments**: Coursework and problem-solving exercises.
- **Resources**: Useful links, papers, and references for further study.

## Learning Progress
A table to track my learning progress:

| Date       | Topic Learned |
|------------|--------------|
| 6 Feb           | Linear Regression              |
|            |              |

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ItsWip/ML_learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```sh
   cd ML_learning
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook (if applicable):
   ```sh
