# Use Case 1: Traffic Management & Accident Prediction in Smart Cities

## 1. Data

### Data Sources:
The data for traffic management and accident prediction comes from various sources:

- **Traffic Cameras & CCTV Feeds**: Provide real-time video footage of road conditions and vehicle movements.
- **GPS Data from Vehicles & Smartphones**: Helps track vehicle speeds, congestion levels, and route choices.
- **Weather Sensors & Forecasts**: Rain, fog, and temperature impact driving conditions.
- **Accident Reports & Police Records**: Historical accident data, including time, location, and cause.
- **IoT Road Sensors & Smart Signals**: Measure vehicle count, speed, and road occupancy.
- **Social Media & Public Reports**: Citizens often report accidents or traffic congestion on platforms like Twitter.

### Data Issues:
1. **Incomplete Data**: Some roads may have missing traffic or accident data due to a lack of sensors.
2. **Noisy Data**: Traffic cameras and GPS trackers may generate inaccurate or redundant data.
3. **Data Imbalance**: Accidents are rare events, making it difficult to train ML models without proper techniques like oversampling.
4. **Integration Challenges**: Combining data from multiple sources (video, IoT sensors, and reports) is complex.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: GPS data and video footage must be anonymized to protect user privacy.

### Types of Data:
#### 1. Structured Data:
- **Vehicle speed** (Numerical)  
- **Traffic density** (Numerical)  
- **Accident reports** (Categorical: minor, major, fatal)  
- **Road type** (Categorical: highway, city road, rural road)  
- **Weather conditions** (Categorical: clear, rain, fog)  

#### 2. Unstructured Data:
- **CCTV footage** (Video)  
- **Social media reports** (Text)  
- **Voice reports from emergency calls** (Audio)  

#### 3. Time-Series Data:
- **Real-time traffic data** over days, weeks, and months  
- **Weather conditions** over time  
- **Accident occurrences** over time

## 2. Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion and accidents cause major delays, economic losses, and safety concerns. The goal is to develop an AI-powered system that predicts traffic congestion and accident-prone zones using real-time and historical data.

### Key Objectives:
- **Predict traffic jams in advance** to optimize signal timings.  
- **Identify high-risk accident zones** to improve road safety.  
- **Provide real-time alerts and alternate routes** to drivers and emergency responders.

# Use Case 2: AI-Powered Personal Finance Management

## 1. Data

### Data Sources:
The data for financial management applications comes from multiple sources:

- **Banking Transactions**: Credit card and debit card spending, ATM withdrawals.
- **User Expense Logs**: Data manually entered by users into budgeting apps.
- **Salary & Income Records**: Paychecks, bonuses, rental income, and side earnings.
- **Financial Market Data**: Interest rates, inflation trends, and stock market movements.
- **Online Shopping & Subscription Services**: Spending on e-commerce platforms, OTT subscriptions, and memberships.

### Data Issues:
1. **Incomplete Transactions**: Some transactions may be missing if a user does not link all accounts.  
2. **Uncategorized Expenses**: Some purchases might not be labeled correctly (e.g., grocery vs. dining).  
3. **Data Privacy Concerns**: Financial data is highly sensitive and requires encryption and anonymization.  
4. **Varying Spending Patterns**: Some users have irregular incomes (freelancers, gig workers), making prediction harder.  
5. **Fraudulent Transactions**: Detecting whether a transaction is genuine or fraudulent requires advanced anomaly detection.  

### Types of Data:
#### 1. Structured Data:
- **Transaction amount** (Numerical)  
- **Expense category** (Categorical: food, travel, rent, shopping)  
- **Income amount** (Numerical)  
- **Savings rate** (Numerical)  

#### 2. Unstructured Data:
- **Transaction descriptions** (Text)  
- **Customer reviews on banking services** (Text)  

#### 3. Time-Series Data:
- **Monthly spending trends**  
- **Salary deposit patterns**  
- **Stock market fluctuations affecting investments**
